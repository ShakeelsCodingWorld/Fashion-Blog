Hi there! This project is a basic HTML page I created to demonstrate my understanding of semantic structure, links, images, and content organization using only HTML. It's a blog-style article titled "An Insiderâ€™s Guide to NYFW", written by a fictional author, Isabelle Rodriguez.

ðŸ’¡ What This Project Shows
This project is ideal for showcasing my foundational web development skills. It includes:

Clear and semantic HTML structure

Proper use of headings, paragraphs, and lists

Internal and external navigation using <a> tags

Inserting and styling images with alt attributes for accessibility

Clean layout that mimics a real-world blog article

ðŸ§  What I Learned & Applied
Navigation: Clicking the profile image scrolls the user down to the contact section using an anchor link (#contact).

External Links: I used a link to an external Wikipedia page that opens in a new tab using `target="blank"
